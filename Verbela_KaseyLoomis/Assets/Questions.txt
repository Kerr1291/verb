Q.How can your implementation be optimized?
A.I think it may come down to which is faster in a given scenario, checking which is closer with loops or callbacks through events.
That being said, it's possible that the way the events and callbacks are being used here may incur enough overhead that a more simple system using loops would be faster but to maintain the separation of dependencies would be much more difficult.
UnityEvents are also known to be a fair bit slower than c#'s Actions, so that would be another small change that could be done.
Aside from events, spatially partitioning the objects and or culling them in some other way would be another way to reduce the amount of objects that need to be considered.
Another optimization would be the immediate publishes that happen as a result of changes, For example: like when a TransformDistanceBeahviour is disabled. If many were disabled simultaneously, this would result in a bunch of redundant checks, so this kind of thing should be batched so that only one publish happens after all the bunch are turned off.

Q. How much time did you spend on your implementation?
A. About a day (Thurs evening + Friday), 6-8 hours of work time for the initial build version.
Unfortunately, due to a family emergency, I was unable to allocate any time to this over the weekend.
About 2 hours on Monday were spent writing comments/documentation for everything.

Q. What was most challenging for you?
A. I'd put a personal challenge on myself to keep the module-ettes/pieces of the project as independent of each other as possible without going to abstract and to try and focus on using unity for the solutions instead of standard c# approaches.

Q. What else would you add to this exercise?
A. The instructions as given were clear and concise, yet very open ended. Maybe a bit more clues as to whether there was a preference to solving issues with more unity or c# centric approach.
